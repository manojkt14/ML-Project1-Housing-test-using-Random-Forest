# 🏡 ML Project 1 - Housing Price Prediction (Random Forest)

This project predicts **housing prices** using the **Random Forest Regression** model.  
It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and testing on sample datasets.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers, encoding, scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering for better model accuracy
- Model training using **Random Forest Regressor**
- Model evaluation with metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²)
- Prediction on test dataset

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Model:** Random Forest Regressor
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Python Script
